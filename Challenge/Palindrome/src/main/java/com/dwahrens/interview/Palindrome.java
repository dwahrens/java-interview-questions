/**
 * This class determines if a String is a palindrome; that is, a word, phrase,
 * or sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backwards.
 *
 * Example words: "madam"; "noon"; "kayak"
 *
 * Example sequences: "123454321"; "abc def ghi ihg fed cba";
 *
 * Example phrases: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"; "Madam, I'm Adam"; "Never odd or even"
 *
 * There are three different methods in this class; one which checks is a word is a palindrome,
 * one that checks if a sequence is a palindrome, and one that checks if a phrase is a palindrome.
 *
 * An empty String is not considered a palindrome.
 *
 * Each method has slightly different rules, so read their documentation carefully.
 *
 * Implement all three methods.
